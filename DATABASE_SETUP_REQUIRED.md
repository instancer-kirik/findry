# Database Setup Required for Landing Pages

## Issue: Missing Database Columns

The landing page functionality requires additional columns in the `projects` table that are currently missing. You need to run the following SQL commands in your database to fix this.

## Required SQL Migration

Run these SQL commands in your PostgreSQL database (via Supabase dashboard, psql, or your preferred database tool):

```sql
-- Add landing page columns to projects table
-- This migration adds the necessary columns for custom landing pages

-- Add the landing_page column to store JSON data
ALTER TABLE projects
ADD COLUMN landing_page jsonb DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add the has_custom_landing flag
ALTER TABLE projects
ADD COLUMN has_custom_landing boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- Create an index on has_custom_landing for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_has_custom_landing ON projects (has_custom_landing) WHERE has_custom_landing = true;

-- Create an index on landing_page for JSON queries
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_landing_page_gin ON projects USING gin (landing_page) WHERE landing_page IS NOT NULL;

-- Update existing projects that might have landing page data
-- This is a safety measure in case there's any existing data
UPDATE projects
SET has_custom_landing = true
WHERE landing_page IS NOT NULL
  AND landing_page != 'null'::jsonb
  AND jsonb_typeof(landing_page) = 'object';

-- Add comments to document the columns
COMMENT ON COLUMN projects.landing_page IS 'JSON data for custom landing page configuration including hero section, sections, theme, and social links';
COMMENT ON COLUMN projects.has_custom_landing IS 'Boolean flag indicating if the project has a custom landing page configured and ready for public viewing';
```

## How to Run This Migration

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the SQL commands above
5. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 2: Command Line (if you have direct access)
```bash
# Connect to your database
psql "postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"

# Run the migration
\i add_landing_page_columns.sql
```

### Option 3: Database GUI Tool
- Use pgAdmin, DBeaver, or similar tool
- Connect to your database
- Execute the SQL commands

## Verification

After running the migration, verify it worked by checking the columns exist:

```sql
-- Verify the changes
SELECT
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'projects'
  AND column_name IN ('landing_page', 'has_custom_landing')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

You should see output like:
```
      column_name      | data_type | is_nullable | column_default
-----------------------+-----------+-------------+---------------
 has_custom_landing    | boolean   | NO          | false
 landing_page          | jsonb     | YES         | 
```

## What This Fixes

Once you run this migration:

1. âœ… The "ðŸ§ª Test Save" button will work
2. âœ… Landing page creation and editing will work
3. âœ… Projects will show landing page options when they have them
4. âœ… The debug info will show `Landing: âœ“` for projects with landing pages
5. âœ… All ProductHunt-like features will be fully functional

## Sample Landing Page Data Structure

After the migration, landing pages will be stored as JSON in the `landing_page` column like this:

```json
{
  "hero_title": "My Amazing Project",
  "hero_subtitle": "Building the future, one component at a time",
  "call_to_action": "Learn More",
  "cta_link": "/projects/project-id",
  "theme": "default",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "features",
      "type": "features", 
      "title": "Key Features",
      "order": 1,
      "visible": true,
      "content": "List of amazing features..."
    }
  ],
  "social_links": [
    {
      "platform": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
      "label": "View Source"
    }
  ]
}
```

## After Migration - Test Steps

1. Refresh your browser
2. Go to any project detail page (`/projects/:id`)
3. Try the "ðŸ§ª Test Save" button - it should now work!
4. Create a real landing page using "Create Landing Page"
5. The debug info should show: `Landing: âœ“ | Data: âœ“ | Public: âœ“`
6. Click "View Landing" to see your landing page

## Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're running the commands as a user with ALTER TABLE permissions
- In Supabase, make sure you're using the service role key, not the anon key

### If the commands fail:
- Check that the `projects` table exists: `\dt projects`
- Verify you're connected to the correct database
- Check for any existing columns with those names: `\d projects`

### If you see "column already exists" errors:
That's fine! It means the columns were already added. You can skip those specific commands.

## Performance Notes

The indexes created will help with:
- Fast queries for projects with landing pages (`has_custom_landing = true`)
- Efficient JSON queries on landing page data
- Better performance in the projects showcase page

## Security Notes

The `landing_page` column stores user-generated content as JSON. The application validates this data before saving, but you may want to add additional database constraints if needed.

## Next Steps

After running this migration, all the ProductHunt-like features we implemented will work perfectly:
- âœ¨ Featured projects on the main page
- ðŸ’– Like and view tracking  
- ðŸ”— Shareable landing pages
- ðŸ“± Social sharing integration
- ðŸŽ¨ Custom themes and layouts
- ðŸ“Š Project discovery and filtering

Your Findry instance will be ready to showcase projects like ProductHunt! ðŸš€
