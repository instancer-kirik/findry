DONT LIKE V. MUCH REWORK OR RENAME
## Overview

PlanAmple is an AI-powered feature designed to enhance Findry's platform by providing contextual explanations of art industry terminology, jargon, and concepts directly within the user interface. The feature aims to make the art world more accessible to newcomers while providing depth for experienced users.

## Problem Statement

1. The art industry uses specialized terminology that creates barriers to entry for newcomers.
2. Understanding context-specific terms is crucial for effective participation in art communities and events.
3. Traditional glossaries are static and don't adapt to different user knowledge levels.
4. Users often need to leave the platform to search for unfamiliar terms, disrupting their experience.

## Objectives

- Create a seamless, non-disruptive way to access term definitions within the platform
- Provide multi-layered explanations that adapt to user expertise
- Support the discovery of related concepts to facilitate deeper learning
- Leverage existing glossary content while expanding through AI-powered generation
- Maintain accuracy and cultural sensitivity in art-related explanations

## Target Users

1. **Newcomers to the Art World**
   - Need simple, accessible explanations
   - Benefit from visual examples and analogies
   - May require background context for industry concepts

2. **Art Students & Emerging Artists**
   - Need more detailed explanations with historical context
   - Benefit from practical applications and examples
   - Interested in relationships between concepts

3. **Art Professionals**

   - Interested in regional/cultural variations in terminology

## Feature Components

### 1. Contextual Term Highlighting

- Intelligent identification of specialized terms within text
- Subtle visual indication of terms with available explanations (dotted underline)
- Prioritization algorithm to avoid over-highlighting common pages

### 2. Multi-layered Explanation Interface

- **Level 1:** Brief definition (1-2 sentences) in plain language
- **Level 2:** Expanded explanation with examples and visual references
- **Level 3:** Comprehensive explanation with historical context, contemporary usage, and scholarly references
- UI that encourages exploration between layers

### 3. Visual Learning Elements

- Relevant images to illustrate concepts where appropriate
- Interactive diagrams for complex concepts (e.g., art movements timeline)
- Visual relationships between connected terms

### 4. AI-Enhanced Content Generation

- Integration with art-specific LLM to generate contextual explanations
- Human review workflow for quality assurance
- Community contribution mechanisms for refinement
- Citation management for sources and references

### 5. Personalization Layer

- Learning history to track previously explored terms
- Adaptation of explanation complexity based on user behavior
- Personalized recommendations for related terms based on interests

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Term Highlighting

- Use subtle dotted underline in a complementary color
- Implement progressive disclosure to avoid visual clutter
- Allow users to toggle highlighting on/off globally

### Explanation Card

- Floating card that appears on hover/tap of highlighted terms
- Minimal, clean design that doesn't obscure main content
- Clear hierarchy of information with progressive disclosure
- Visual indicators for available explanation levels
- Quick actions (save, share, full-page view)

### Navigation & Discovery

- Related terms shown as interactive tags
- Breadcrumb trail for term exploration journey
- Search functionality within the explanation interface
- Option to browse full glossary in dedicated view

## Technical Requirements

1. **Term Detection System**
   - Regular expression patterns for common art terms
   - NLP-based entity recognition for context-specific terminology
   - Term priority scoring algorithm based on specificity and relevance

2. **Explanation Database**
   - Structured storage for multi-level explanations
   - Tagging system for related concepts
   - Version control for explanation updates
   - Source attribution mechanism

3. **AI Integration**
   - API connection to specialized art knowledge LLM
   - Content generation templates for consistent output
   - Feedback loop for quality improvement
   - Fact-checking mechanism with trusted sources

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Lazy loading of explanation content
   - Client-side caching of frequently accessed terms
   - Progressive loading of visual assets
   - Optimized rendering to avoid layout shifts

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement basic term highlighting for a curated list of 100 essential art terms
- Develop core explanation card UI with Level 1 definitions
- Create manual content for initial term set
- Integrate with existing glossary data

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement Metrics**
   - Term exploration rate (% of highlighted terms clicked)
   - Depth of exploration (levels accessed per session)
   - Related term discovery rate
   - Time spent engaging with explanations

2. **Learning Metrics**
   - Repeat lookups reduction (learning retention)
   - Knowledge progression (complexity level engagement over time)
   - Self-reported comprehension improvement

3. **Platform Metrics**
   - Session duration impact
   - Reduction in platform exits for terminology searches
