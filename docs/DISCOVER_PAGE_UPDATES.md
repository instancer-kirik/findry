## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Layout Component**
   - Added the Layout component around the Discover page to ensure the navbar and footer are displayed properly.

2. **Data Fetching Issues**
   - Updated data fetching logic to use the `useDiscoverData` hook consistently.
   - Added fallback to mock data when Supabase data isn't available.
   - Created a Supabase stored procedure `search_discover_content` to handle advanced search and filtering.

3. **Layout Problems**
   - Fixed sidebar positioning (now properly on the left side).
   - Removed duplicate filter buttons.
   - Improved mobile layout and responsiveness.

4. **Component Interface Issues**
   - Updated `CategoryItemsGrid` to work with the `ContentItemProps` interface.
   - Standardized data structures across components.
   - Added proper display of subtype and limited tag display.

5. **Selection and Organization System**
   - Enhanced item selection flow for event and collection creation.
   - Implemented organization system with User Categories, Circles, and Tags.
   - Added contextual actions based on selected items.

## Organization System Structure

### 1. User Categories

User Categories provide a way to organize contacts and collaborators:

- **Circles**: Groups of people for specific purposes
  - Collaborators
  - Favorites
  - Potential Venues
  - Session Musicians

- **Tags**: Attribute-based organization that crosses category boundaries
  - Genre-based (Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical)
  - Role-based (Producer, Vocalist, Audio Engineer)
  - Style-based (Minimalist, Contemporary, Traditional)

### 2. Content Organization

The system organizes content into several main categories:

- **Artists**: Creative professionals organized by discipline
  - Music (Vocalists, Producers, Instrumentalists, DJs)
  - Visual (Painters, Photographers, Digital Artists)
  - Performance (Actors, Dancers, Multidisciplinary)

- **Resources**: Tools and spaces available for creative work
  - Spaces (Studios, Galleries, Practice Rooms)
  - Tools (Equipment, Instruments, Software)
  - Services (Sound Engineers, Session Musicians)

- **Events**: Time-based gatherings and opportunities
  - Concerts, Exhibitions, Workshops, Festivals

- **Venues**: Physical locations for performances and events
  - Clubs, Concert Halls, Theaters, Outdoor Spaces

- **Communities**: Groups organized around interests or goals
  - Music, Art, Tech, Social, Professional

- **Brands**: Commercial entities with collaboration potential
  - Labels, Equipment Manufacturers, Fashion Brands

### 3. Selection System

The platform implements selection mechanisms that connect these organizational elements:

- **Item Selection for Events**: Users can select artists, venues, and resources when creating events
- **Contextual Actions**: Different actions available based on the type of selected item
- **Cross-Category Connections**: Tags and filters work across category boundaries

## Implementation Details

### 1. Discover Page Structure

The Discover page now follows this structure:

```tsx
<Layout>
  <DiscoverHeader />
  <div className="container">
    <div className="flex">
      {/* Sidebar */}
      <DiscoverSidebar activeTabData={items} activeTab={activeTab} />
      
      {/* Main Content */}
      <div className="flex-1">
        <DiscoverFilters />
        <CategoryItemsGrid items={items} />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Layout>
```

### 2. Data Flow

1. User selects a tab type (artists, resources, etc.)
2. `useDiscoverData` hook fetches relevant data from Supabase
3. If Supabase data isn't available, falls back to mock data
4. Additional filters (tags, styles, etc.) are applied to the data
5. Results are displayed in the `CategoryItemsGrid` component

### 3. Supabase Integration

Created a robust stored procedure for searching content:

- Handles multiple content types
- Supports text search across name and location fields
- Filters by tags
- Returns consistent data structure for all content types

### 4. Mobile Experience

- Improved mobile layout with dedicated mobile view components
- Fixed sidebar toggle functionality
- Enhanced filter display on smaller screens

### 5. Selection Mechanics

- **Direct Selection**: Click on items to select them for events or collections
- **Quick Actions**: Context-specific action buttons appear based on item type
- **Selection Persistence**: Selected items are stored in state and can be referenced
- **Integration with Event Creation**: Selected artists, venues, or resources are passed to the event creation flow

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Test the Discover page on various devices and screen sizes
   - Ensure proper data loading and error handling

2. **Selection Improvements**
   - Add multi-select capability for batch operations
   - Implement drag-and-drop for organization
   - Create saved selections/collections feature

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Enhance filter UI with more advanced options
   - Add animation transitions between filtered views 
   - Expand organization system with custom categories
