# Discover Page Updates

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Layout Component**
   - Added the Layout component around the Discover page to ensure the navbar and footer are displayed properly.

2. **Data Fetching Issues**
   - Updated data fetching logic to use the `useDiscoverData` hook consistently.
   - Added fallback to mock data when Supabase data isn't available.
   - Created a Supabase stored procedure `search_discover_content` to handle advanced search and filtering.

3. **Layout Problems**
   - Fixed sidebar positioning (now properly on the left side).
   - Removed duplicate filter buttons.
   - Improved mobile layout and responsiveness.

4. **Component Interface Issues**
   - Updated `CategoryItemsGrid` to work with the `ContentItemProps` interface.
   - Standardized data structures across components.
   - Added proper display of subtype and limited tag display.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Discover Page Structure

The Discover page now follows this structure:

```tsx
<Layout>
  <DiscoverHeader />
  <div className="container">
    <div className="flex">
      {/* Sidebar */}
      <DiscoverSidebar activeTabData={items} activeTab={activeTab} />
      
      {/* Main Content */}
      <div className="flex-1">
        <DiscoverFilters />
        <CategoryItemsGrid items={items} />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Layout>
```

### 2. Data Flow

1. User selects a tab type (artists, resources, etc.)
2. `useDiscoverData` hook fetches relevant data from Supabase
3. If Supabase data isn't available, falls back to mock data
4. Additional filters (tags, styles, etc.) are applied to the data
5. Results are displayed in the `CategoryItemsGrid` component

### 3. Supabase Integration

Created a robust stored procedure for searching content:

- Handles multiple content types
- Supports text search across name and location fields
- Filters by tags
- Returns consistent data structure for all content types

### 4. Mobile Experience

- Improved mobile layout with dedicated mobile view components
- Fixed sidebar toggle functionality
- Enhanced filter display on smaller screens

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Test the Discover page on various devices and screen sizes
   - Ensure proper data loading and error handling

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Enhance filter UI with more advanced options
   - Add animation transitions between filtered views
